#### Whats in MVP3:

1. Folder titled Floridaman (beacuse Matt is from Florida) that holds python files of all our data cleaning functions
2. KNN Impute Metrics to score our KNN imputer
3. Link to our dashboard (powerBi is only visible to those granted access) 
4. Principle Component Analysis to help with feature reduction
5. Random Forest Model to originally test the swapping of the balancing and imputation function
6. Rand Forest Model Noise whichs integrates a noise variable into the model to identify and help in feature reduction
7. Random Forest Reduced Features which shows the final model with the reduced features
8. Random Forest Reduced With Shap integrates our final model and the shap plots
9. Three html files of the shap force plots that depict the threshold values for our recommendations for each failure type
10. Stepwise python file that was used to systematically added in features and visualize the effect each variable had on the model

#### Launching the Jupyter Notebook

All of these files can be run through jupyter's shell or through the virtual environment we set up. Look at the home page for detailed setup instructions for the virtual environment.
