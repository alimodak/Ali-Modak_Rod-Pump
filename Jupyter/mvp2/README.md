#### Whats in MVP2:

1. Folder titled Floridaman (beacuse Matt is from Florida) that holds python files of all our data cleaning functions
2. KNN Model which we later decided to get rid of because it did not preform as well as the Random Forest
3. Random Forest Model where we implemented the balancing function onto the KNN imputer
4. Interactive SHAP force plot produced by the Random Forest model
5. SHAP summary plot to show the key features influencing one failure type

#### Launching the Jupyter Notebook

All of these files can be run through jupyter's shell or through the virtual environment we set up. Look at the home page for detailed setup instructions for the virtual environment.
