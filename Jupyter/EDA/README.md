#### What's in EDA:

1. Images folder that contains png files of all the plots from our intial pairaplot analysis
2. Word document containing descriptions of all the features from the raw data csv file given to us by ConocoPhillips
3. EDA Assignment which was used to initally create the pairaplot/boxplot to analyze relationships between features in the raw data  
4. Exploratory Data Analysis where we identified and analyzed everything to do with the data (eg. null and missing values, redundant features, etc.)
5. Data cleaning document that layed out key null percentages of features in the raw data which helped pave the way for our data cleaning functions used in MVP3 and MVP2

#### Launching the Jupyter Notebook

All of these files can be run through jupyter's shell or through the virtual environment we set up. Look at the home page for detailed setup instructions for the virtual environment.
